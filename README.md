An [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) plugin that lets your viewers redeem videos or sounds on stream via Twitch Channel Points.

## How's this better than [TR!GGER FYRE](https://overlays.thefyrewire.com/widgets/triggerfyre/)?

- Free and open source.
- Use your locally saved videos, no need to upload anything to the server.
- Has a nice UI to edit channel point rewards right inside OBS!
- Plays the videos natively in OBS without a browser source. This means better FPS and quality.
- Can play a random video if you want (just add several videos to a VLC Video Source).
- Reward redemptions can be put in a queue so that they don't play simultaneously.

## Setting up

### Installing on Windows
1. Install the latest version of Visual C++ Redistributable from [here](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).
2. Download and run the exe installer from [this link](https://github.com/gottagofaster236/RewardsTheater/releases/latest).
3. Instead of the installer, you can download the zip file and unpack it into your OBS installation folder (usually `C:\Program Files\obs-studio`).

### Installing on macOS
1. Download the `macos-universal.pkg` file from [here](https://github.com/gottagofaster236/RewardsTheater/releases/latest).
2. **The installer is not signed because an Apple signature is expensive.**
   First double-click the downloaded installer and click "Done" on the warning. Then allow the installer to run with instructions from the [Apple website](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unknown-developer-mh40616/mac).
3. Click "Next" in the installer until the plugin is installed.

### Installing on Linux
<details>

+ #### **Debian/Ubuntu**
  For Ubuntu and other Debian-based distros, you can download the deb file from [this link](https://github.com/gottagofaster236/RewardsTheater/releases/latest). Then install it via
  ```
  sudo dpkg -i /path/to/deb/file
  ```

+ #### **Flathub**
  You can install RewardsTheater from Flathub via
  ```
  flatpak install flathub com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.RewardsTheater

  ```
</details>

### Adding a source
1. RewardsTheater supports videos and sounds. The instructions are identical in both cases.
2. Add an OBS source for each video you want to play as a channel points reward. It has to be either Media Source or VLC Video Source:
   
   ![source](readme_images/source.png)
3. Select a video file for the source from your computer. If you want the video to appear and hide smoothly, select the show/hide transitions for the source:
   
     ![transition](readme_images/transition.png)
4. Position the source on the scene in the way that you like.
5. If you want to hear the videos yourself when the chat plays them, go to Audio Mixer, right-click the source, select "Advanced Audio Properties", and choose "Monitor and Output" under "Audio Monitoring".

### Adding a random video source
You can use a VLC Video Source with several videos in the playlist. Then RewardsTheater will play a random video from this playlist every time.

### Creating a reward
1. Go to Tools ‚Üí RewardsTheater.
   
   ![tools](readme_images/tools.png)
2. You'll have to log into Twitch first by clicking the "Log in" button.
3. After that, you can hit "Add reward". Select the source you added earlier as the Media Source for the reward. 
**Hit "Test source" in order to test whether the source will work.**
 Due to the limitations of Twitch API, if you want to upload a custom icon, you're gonna have to do this inside the browser.
   
   ![add_reward](readme_images/add_reward.png)

4. You can edit the reward later by clicking on it in the Tools ‚Üí RewardsTheater menu.

   ![settings](readme_images/settings.png)

5. If there are a lot of rewards, you can put the media sources onto a separate scene, and add that scene to other scenes.

### Monitoring rewards
1. During stream, you can monitor the reward queue if there's a lot of redemptions at the same time and cancel them by clicking the cross button. The viewer's channel points are refunded if you cancel a reward.

   ![rewards_queue](readme_images/rewards_queue.png)

2. You can click "Pause reward playback" on the main settings screen if you don't want the videos playing for some time. During this time, the user will get their points refunded as well.
